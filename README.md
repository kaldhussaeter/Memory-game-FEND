#$ Memory Game Project

This is my final project in the Intro to programming course at Udacity.com.
The project is about building a fully working matching game/memory game in html, css and JS.


## How to play

In this game you are going to find pairs of the same card. Simply click one card and it will flip over,
click another card and see if it's the same. If it's not the same card the cards will turn over and that
counts as one move. If you manage to find two identical cards they will stay open and count one match.
Eventually when you've matched all 8 pairs, a modal will open and tell you how many moves you used, and
the time you used. But be careful, it's highly addictive!
